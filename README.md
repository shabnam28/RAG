# RAG
I will implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application in this repository.
## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It’s a technique that combines:
- Retrieval – Searching a large database, documents, or knowledge base to find relevant information.
- Generation – Using a language model (like GPT) to create an answer based on the retrieved information.

Instead of the AI just “guessing” or relying on its memory, RAG ensures the output is grounded in actual data.
